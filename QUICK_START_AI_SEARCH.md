## Example Conversation

**You**: "Can you help me find notes about nostr developers?"

**AI**: "I'll help you search for notes about nostr developers. Here's the search URL:

https://nostr.band/?q=nostr+developers

This will show all notes mentioning 'nostr developers'. Click the link to see the results on nostr.band."

---

**You**: "Actually, find MY notes about nostr developers"

**AI**: "Here's a search for your notes about nostr developers:

https://nostr.band/?q=nostr+developers+by:npub1r0rs5q2gk0e3dk3nlc7gnu378ec6cnlenqp8a3cjhyzu6f8k5sgs4sq9ac

This filters the results to only show notes you've posted. Click to see all your posts about nostr developers."

**You**: "Find articles about privacy from this year"

**AI**: "Here's a search for privacy articles from 2024:

https://nostr.band/?q=privacy+kind:30023+since:2024-01-01

This searches for:
- Articles (kind:30023) about privacy

## Common Use Cases

## Pro Tips

1. **Be specific**: "Find kind:1 notes about Bitcoin privacy" works better than "find stuff about Bitcoin"

2. **Use NPUBs for authors**: You need the full npub format for searching by author (the AI will tell you if you just give a name)

3. **Combine filters**: "Find my articles about Bitcoin from 2024" uses author + kind + date + topic filters

4. **Standard dates**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2024-01-15) for date filters

5. **Event kinds**: Common ones are:
   - `kind:1` - regular notes
   - `kind:30023` - articles
   - `kind:9735` - zaps
   - `kind:6` - reposts
   - `kind:7` - reactions
